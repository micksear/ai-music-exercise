# Coding exercise with DevOps elements for AI Music

The code in this project has basic functionality in the form of a 
Spring Boot project to expose an endpoint that calls a 3rd party 
service and transforms the response. It has stubbed tests, with a very basic 
'happy path' test working.

Tests exist that currently fail for the /transformed endpoint.  We'd 
like you to refactor that endpoint so the tests pass, complete the tests that are
currently empty, and then create a dockerfile that runs the jar generated by
the build script.

The purpose of the exercise isn't to see if you can attain 100% test coverage, or
for you to create different types of test like integration test, performance test, 
etc., but whether you are able to quickly adapt the code to make the tests pass, and 
create a simple test from scratch.

Please clone the repo to start work, and submit your solution as a zip file.
